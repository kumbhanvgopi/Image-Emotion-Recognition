# Image-Emotion-Recognition
This is my college Minor project.
Install required dependencies

- Computer vision for emotion detection using facial expression recognition,at enhancing human-machine interaction.
- Used Python library OpenCV for image extraction and facial feature identification with standard web camera Object
Detection.
- Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with six layers for accurate emotion detection
using Segmentation. That aimed at getting accuracy from 70% to 96%.
- Tech stack used: Python, Opencv, CNN.
